# FlowCTRL
FlowCTRL is a short-form content blocker for YouTube &amp; Instagram. It breaks the endless scroll by blocking Reels, Shorts, and swipe-based feeds while keeping the rest of each platform usable. FlowCTRL helps you control your attention, use social media intentionally, and stop losing time to algorithms.
